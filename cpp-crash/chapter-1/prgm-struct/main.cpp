// INCLUDE: PULLS IN CODE FROM AN EXT LIBRARY
// Importing libraries keeps you from having to "reinvent the wheel" when coding.
// By including a prewritten set of code, you save time and effort.
// Here, the Standard C IO Library is imported.
#include <cstdio>

// MAIN: A C++ PROGRAM'S STARTING POINT
// This function, main(), is the entry point for c++ programs.
// An entry point is a function that executes when the user runs a program.
// A function is a block of code that can take inputs, execute instructions, and return an output.
int main() {

    // PRINTF: A FUNCTION, PRINTS TO THE CONSOLE
    // This prints characters to the console.
    // In this case, it prints "Hello, World!", with a trailing newline.
    printf("Hello, World!\n");

    // RETURN: EXITS A FUNCTION, RETURNS A VALUE
    // Here return is used to exit the program.
    // In this case, it also sends an exit code, 0, to the operating system.
    // This code (usually 0 when successful) tells the OS how well the program ran.
    return 0;
